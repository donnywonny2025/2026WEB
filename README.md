## Recent Changes (Feb 9, 2026)

### Project Card Poster Fixes
Original poster images for cards 2, 3, and 6 had cinematic letterbox bars baked into the files. Clean frames were extracted directly from the source videos:

| Card | Old Poster | New Poster | Source Video |
|---|---|---|---|
| 02 — New Balance | `NBPOSTER.jpg` ❌ bars | `NBPOSTER_clean.jpg` ✅ | `NBQuickLoop2.mp4` |
| 03 — Danny Was Here | `DannyPoster.jpg` ❌ bars | `DannyPoster_clean.jpg` ✅ | `DannyQuickLoop3.mp4` |
| 06 — Justice | Wrong files entirely | `JusticePoster.jpg` ✅ | `JusticeLoop.mp4` |

### Contact Section Micro-Animations
- **Shimmer:** Gradient highlight sweeps left-to-right across "CONTACT" text, pauses ~2.5s, loops
- **Accent line glow:** Light pulse travels down the orange accent line and fades out

### Nav Bar Micro-Animations (Feb 11, 2026)
- **Logo shimmer:** Faint light sweep across "JEFF KERR" like embossed metal (8s cycle)
- **Staggered nav link glow:** Work → About → Contact underlines pulse in sequence (runway lights effect)
- **CTA button sweep:** Diagonal light streak across "START A PROJECT" button (6s cycle)

## Deployment

The site is a single self-contained HTML file (`v4.html`).
For deployment, rename to `index.html` and push to the GitHub repo connected to Netlify.
Video assets in `Videos/` must be deployed alongside.

## To Resume
1. Open `v4.html` — this is the active working file
2. `the_editorial.html` is the locked launch copy — safe to revert to
3. `v4_pre_animations.html` — revert point before nav animations
4. All copy verified against live jefferykerr.com on Feb 9, 2026

## Git Versioning

Local git repo initialized. Commit history:
1. `V4 'The Editorial' — production site with clean posters and contact animations`
2. `Add nav micro-animations: logo shimmer, staggered link glows, CTA button sweep`

Remote: `git@github.com:colour8k/2026WEB.git` (pending auth setup)
