# Client Preview Area

Drop HTML files here to share quick mockups with clients.

## How To Use

1. Create a folder: `preview/client-name/`
2. Put your `index.html` (and any assets) in it
3. Push: `git add . && git commit -m "preview for [client]" && git push`
4. Share: `jefferykerr.com/preview/client-name/`
5. Done? Delete the folder and push again.

## Tips

- Use unique folder names so URLs aren't guessable (e.g. `dan-egan-feb20` not just `dan`)
- This folder is NOT indexed or linked anywhere on the site
- Nobody will find it unless you share the direct link
